Predict housing prices using the 1990 California data set (~20,000 homes)
and a 2-layer neural net of 5 neurons each, where everything (forward and backward propagation, etc.) is done from scratch using Python.

Let A1, ..., A5 and B1, ..., B5 be the activations of the 
first and second layers.  What are the meanings of these activations
in a trained model?
